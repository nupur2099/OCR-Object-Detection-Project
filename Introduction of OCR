Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the electronic conversion of images of handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text.
After that we can do all kinds of things that we can do with a normal text or document file like print, search, etc.
There are 2 types of Text:-
a. Structured Text:- Comprised of clearly defined text types with patterns that make them easily searchable.
b. Unstructured Text:- Comprised not easily searchable as structured Text.
